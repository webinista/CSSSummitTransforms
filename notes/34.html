<h1>Overall Transform Demo</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Perspective: 1px
	<li>Perspective: 10000px
    <li>Let's play with rotate3d: rotate each by 100 degrees
    <li>Now let's adjust the perspective: 0
    <li>Now let's try 100px perspective
    <li>Now let's try 1000px perspective
    <li>Can see that the larger the value gets, the further away it appears to be
    <li>Now let's take a look at translate 3d
    <li>75px 75px 75px: no apparent change to the z value
    <li>Adjust perspective to 100px and it disappears
    <li>It's actually off screen because of how the perspective matrix is calculated
    <li>Adjust perspective to 300px and we can see it. It appears pretty huge
    <li>Adjust perspective to 500px and it looks a little smaller and further from us
    <li>Adjust perspective to 1000px and it looks a little smaller / further still
    <li>No hard upper or lower limits to these values.
    <li>Depends on the cumulative values of each function and property.
</ul>
